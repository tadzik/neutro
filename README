neutro is a module installer for Perl 6.
It's a temporary working solution, while experts build
the Real Deal (proto, pls). The difference is that neutro works :)

Patches, ideas and criticism welcome.

Bootstraping:
As neutro is not dependency-free, it comes with a set of libs which
will help it install itself. To bootstrap neutro, use something like
this:

PERL6LIB=tmplib bin/neutro .

Usage:
neutro update
neutro list
neutro perl6-Acme-Meow # install perl6-Acme-Meow from the module ecosystem
neutro ufo json        # install multiple modules in one go
neutro .               # install a module in the current directory
